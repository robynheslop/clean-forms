## Description

In 2020, we have seen many changes occur in the way we live our lives due to COVID-19. For many businesses, one change arose that needed addressing quickly is the abilty to assess a clientâ€™s risk of having covid before engaging them in services. 

Instead of completing this form in person, spreading germs and wasting paper, Clean Forms allows businesses to create custom questionnaires and email them directly to clients for them to complete before arriving at on site. 

Reducing the risk of exposure to everyone involved. 

Find the application live on Heroku [here](https://cleanforms.herokuapp.com/).
